# Code samples from the Epson PX-4 Operating System Reference Manual

Most code is just typed in, not checked yet. 

The assembly code programs are from Part II of the manual, the BASIC programs from part III.

In the derived directory are programs which are based on the OSRM code, but modified in some way.

Scans of the OSRM can be found here: https://electrickery.nl/comp/px4/doc/. These scans do not contain OCRed text, only images.

The intention here is to have ASCII versions of the programs (BASIC and Z80 assembler) ready to run or to assemble and run.

There is no licence here, as the code is created and copyrighted by Epson. The PX-4 Operating System Reference Manual is published in 1985. Publication number Y20699101600.
